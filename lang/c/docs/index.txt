== Introduction to Avro

Avro is a data serialization system.

Avro provides:

* Rich data structures.
* A compact, fast, binary data format.
* A container file, to store persistent data.
* Remote procedure call (RPC).

This document will focus on the C API for Avro.  To learn more about

The C implementation is still *alpha* is not ready for
production use.  The current code is being tested on
+MacOS X+ and +Linux+.

We're making rapid progress and the +avro.h+ header file 
can give you an idea of what the API will likely look like.

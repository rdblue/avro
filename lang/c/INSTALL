Installation instructions
=========================

The Avro library is written in ANSI C.  It uses cmake as its build
manager.


Prerequisites
-------------

Avro doesn't have any prerequisite libraries, but you need asciidoc [1]
and source-highlight [2] installed to build Avro's documentation.  The
build scripts will automatically detect whether these tools are
installed, and will skip the documentation if they're not.

Building from source
--------------------

The swanson language uses cmake as its build manager.  In most cases,
you should be able to build the source code using the following:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake .. \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PREFIX \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

You might have to run the last command using sudo, if you need
administrative privileges to write to the $PREFIX directory.

The "RelWithDebInfo" build type will build an optimized copy of the
library, including debugging symbols.  Use the "Release" build type if
you don't want debugging symbols.  Use the "Debug" build type if you
want a non-optimized library, with debugging symbols.

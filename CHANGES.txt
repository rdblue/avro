Avro Change Log

Avro 1.1.0 (8 September 2009)

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    AVRO-110. GenericData and ReflectData have been converted to use a
    singleton pattern.  Calls to static methods on these classes must
    be replaced with calls on the singleton instance. (cutting)

    AVRO-41. GenericArray's constructor now requires a Schema, so that
    it may implement Comparable consistently with AVRO-108. (cutting)

    AVRO-41. Several GenericDatumWriter methods (instanceOf(),
    isRecord(), etc.) have been moved to GenericData, where they can
    better be shared with comparators.  Applications which subclassed
    GenericDatumWriter overriding these methods must now instead
    subclass GenericData and pass their subclass to
    GenericDatumWriter. (cutting)

    AVRO-41. SpecificRecord's schema() method has been renamed
    getSchema(), since it now implements the new GenericContainer
    interface shared with GenericRecord. (cutting)

  NEW FEATURES

    AVRO-50. Implmenent JSON data codec in Java. (Thiruvalluvan
    M. G. & cutting)

    AVRO-76. Add Java RPC plugin framework.  (George Porter)

    AVRO-104. Permit null fields in Java reflection.
    (Eelco Hillenius via cutting)

    AVRO-92. Describe JSON data encoding in specification
    document. (cutting)

    AVRO-108.  Add Java implementation of binary comparator.
    (cutting)

    AVRO-41. Java generic and specific data instances now implement
    Comparable.  The implementation is consistent with the binary
    comparator added in AVRO-108. (cutting)

    AVRO-109.  Add Java support for controlling sort order via schema
    annotations.  Record fields now support an "order" attribute whose
    possible values are "increasing" (the default), "decreasing", and
    "ignore".  (cutting)

    AVRO-111.  Document sort ordering in the specification. (cutting)

  IMPROVEMENTS

    AVRO-71.  C++: make deserializer more generic.  (Scott Banachowski
    via cutting)

    multi-byte characters.  Add tests.  (Matt Massie via cutting)

    AVRO-82. Add checkstyle to java compilation.  (Thiruvalluvan
    M. G. via cutting)

    AVRO-81. Switch back from TestNG to JUnit. (Konstantin Boudnik via
    cutting)

    AVRO-84, AVRO-85.  Clarify a few things in the specification
    document.  (Thiruvalluvan M. G. and cutting)

    AVRO-89. In fields of Java generated classes, use unboxed numeric
    types.  (cutting)

    AVRO-83. In generated Java code, elide unions with null. (cutting)

    AVRO-98. Fix C++ schema parser to permit JSON attributes in any
    order and to ignore extra attributes. (Scott Banachowski via cutting)

  OPTIMIZATIONS

  BUG FIXES

    change test-java build target to fail on javadoc warnings.
    (Thiruvalluvan M. G. and cutting)

    AVRO-90. Fix Java's JSON codec to correctly encode unions. (cutting)

    AVRO-95. Fix writing of Java reflect-based unions.  Also extend
    DataFileWriter to permit adding branches to a union schema while
    writing.

    AVRO-88. Fix Java's BlockingBinaryEncoder to correctly override
    writeEnum().  (Ravi Gummadi via cutting)

    AVRO-61. Add Python support for reading blocked data.
    (Ravi Gummadi via cutting)

    AVRO-97.  Fix various C++ bugs.  (Scott Banachowski via cutting)

    AVRO-100.  In spec, remove warning about blocking being draft. (cutting)

    AVRO-107.  Fix Protocol#equals() and Protocol#hashCode() to
    consider the protocol's types, and also fix Schema#equals() to not
    throw ClassCastException when a fixed schema is compared to
    non-fixed. (cutting)

    AVRO-112.  Turn off C++ debug output.  (Scott Banachowski via cutting)

    AVRO-114.  Fix "cdoc" Ant target to correctly run doxygen.
    (Matt Massie via cutting)

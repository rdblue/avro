Avro 1.2.0 (14 October 2009)

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    AVRO-115. Remove RPC's session notion to facilliate the use of
    stateless transports like UDP and HTTP.  Add a UDP transport.
    (cutting)

    AVRO-120. Improved package and namespace handling, including:

     * Removed explicit package-name specification from specific and
       reflect public APIs.  Package names are now determined either
       by namespace declarations or by a Java classes, as appropriate.

     * Changed the specific compiler to generate separate java files
       per class, rather than nested classes.  This permits generated
       classes to be in packages declared in their schema namespaces.

     * Fix namespace defaulting.  The default namespace is declared in
       the outermost schema or protocol.  Nested schemas can now
       declare different namespaces than the default.

     * Names may now be specified with a dotted notation, e.g.,
       "foo.bar.Baz", to indicate the name "Baz" in namespace
       "foo.bar".  This permits one to refer to schemas in a namespace
       other than the default.

  NEW FEATURES

    AVRO-121.  Permit reflect and specific datum readers to read data
    written with a different version of the schema than is current.

Avro 1.1.0 (8 September 2009)

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    AVRO-110. GenericData and ReflectData have been converted to use a
    singleton pattern.  Calls to static methods on these classes must
    be replaced with calls on the singleton instance. (cutting)

    AVRO-41. GenericArray's constructor now requires a Schema, so that
    it may implement Comparable consistently with AVRO-108. (cutting)

    AVRO-41. Several GenericDatumWriter methods (instanceOf(),
    isRecord(), etc.) have been moved to GenericData, where they can
    better be shared with comparators.  Applications which subclassed
    GenericDatumWriter overriding these methods must now instead
    subclass GenericData and pass their subclass to
    GenericDatumWriter. (cutting)

    AVRO-41. SpecificRecord's schema() method has been renamed
    getSchema(), since it now implements the new GenericContainer
    interface shared with GenericRecord. (cutting)

  NEW FEATURES

    AVRO-50. Implmenent JSON data codec in Java. (Thiruvalluvan
    M. G. & cutting)

    AVRO-76. Add Java RPC plugin framework.  (George Porter)

    (cutting)

    AVRO-41. Java generic and specific data instances now implement
    Comparable.  The implementation is consistent with the binary
    comparator added in AVRO-108. (cutting)

    AVRO-109.  Add Java support for controlling sort order via schema
    annotations.  Record fields now support an "order" attribute whose
    possible values are "increasing" (the default), "decreasing", and
    "ignore".  (cutting)

    AVRO-111.  Document sort ordering in the specification. (cutting)

    order and to ignore extra attributes. (Scott Banachowski via cutting)

    non-fixed. (cutting)

    AVRO-112.  Turn off C++ debug output.  (Scott Banachowski via cutting)

    AVRO-114.  Fix "cdoc" Ant target to correctly run doxygen.
